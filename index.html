                            Hi! My name is David Savenok and I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduating in May 2026.
                            I have a passion for systems programming and robotics, security, and deep learning.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            I began a software engineering internship at Everfox in the Summer of 2025 and have been interning every since. So far, I have developed expertise in Linux file systems and bash, networking security hardening,
                            and infrastructure tooling. I built a stateless RPM overlay package manager that reduced developer package
                            refresh times by over 95%, analyzed FIPS-compliant web servers for secure deployments, and created advanced
                            USB security auditing tools for RHEL-based systems. Currently, I am working on DevOps automation and security. You can learn more on my experience page if you're interested!
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            Beyond internships, I have completed various technical projects. In the past year, I led control systems and a software team of five people for a 6-axis robotic arm, and to cap off 2025, 
                            I built a motion tracking turret with OpenCV, a Raspberry Pi, and 3D printed parts. In the past, I have developed full-stack web applications, like a social media site, an email client, and an e-commerce platform. 
                            You can view a full list of things I've done on my projects page! 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            I'm primarily driven by challenging problems that require both mathematical rigor and engineering pragmatism, given that I am studying
                            computer science AND math. I have molded my degree pathway towards analytical courses that require deep puzzle-solving, enrolling in 
                            classes on algorithms, deep learning, networking, and scientific computing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            I also happen to be a real-life person and not a chatbot hoping to pass ATS, so I have some hobbies that I'm passionate about.
                            This past summer, I picked up piano and have been loving it in my free time, and I have been playing violin for over 10 years. 
                            I'm extremely passionate about fitness, so I value working out consistently, running, and eating healthy. I'm training
                            for a half-marathon this Spring, so I'd love any tips!
